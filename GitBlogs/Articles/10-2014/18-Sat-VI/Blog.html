"What's this game now? Being the BAT?'"
"You love to sneak around as usual... Bat."

"You're not a clone of mine. The waveID just happen to share the same initial string. Based on your action, you seems to know everything the moment you were turned on, you knew where to go, where the Bain is. There's only one person who could do that.''"

"And you'd assumed that person died long time ago?'"
"I know he did not. An empty dead never suit someone with that kind of mansion."

"Seems like your memory is still very good, even after you've died once.'
"What's the plan now? Playing hero?"

"That's a role. And yes.''"
 
"Back then, my capture. You were behindi t!'""""
"Half of your network are my nodes back then, some I met, some I personally know, and one is a bot. One of your regular partner, is me."
"The reason why the moment I got inside the cop place, nobody was helping..."
"Precisely, I caught myself a big rat. A good one, in good condition, with perfect shape. The one and only rat"
"What are you gonna do with POE? THe machine you created?"

"Nothing. I created it, but it act on its own, with thought pattern inherite from its creator. I simply created it 500 years ago, and it is well."

"What about your son?"

"I don't care. If he found POE to be a competitor, he is free to do as he wish.'"

"What about me? Why?"

"How's it being the man who's in charge of everything these decaede?''"

"I should be memored am I? I created them, and they all impact the whole galaxy. Now the world look at earth as if it is not hidden like the pass. What else do you think is stupid? All you did was child play."
"Let's assume that POG won the position. What if you could assess POG and do what you wish with its decision? What if, you made it that way? To the game of milennia?"
"That would be entertaining at its most, shouldn't it?'"

"You waited for 100 years under that hole After I beat you to a pulp. You were sending package, and not just that, to develop and gathering nano particle. So what are those packages? That would be easy to understand. A package which affect a very large amount of data, or has spread with many nodes. A packge that is still in process, that now you've waked from the manhole to receive benefit from it. Your plan were to have POE reached out to the Galaxy, for the sole purpose of concealing the whole galaxy discorvery you've made in the past. You know POE could reach out because it is a machine. You know there are life form out there. And once an interstella war broke out, you will smirk,...'"
"And become a hero, the Bat return, safe the day... sounds entertaining? That's my script for this episode.'"
"So it seems.."
Red revealed the blue eye on his head. Like a mouth.
"You recreated that machine, I see," observing the Bat.
"10 to the 9 more efficent than your junk. Olog(n) difficult," the blue eye shined.
"A junk made 500 years ago, heresy."

"POG can do whatever it wanted to get the seat. I'm a Senate, and I cast the vote. If POG get the seat, it should deserve it. But, I will not allow intefere," said the red machine.
"POG really know how to speak these day... It really have learnt outside of my reach,"
"It would be dangerous if such a thing were to be under the most dangerous being in this Univer, don't you think?'"
-The most dangerous being in the Universe? And you said I was nothing just now.." _Prepared his stand, the Bat.
-"Soon you will be," the red knife shines a blue lit light.

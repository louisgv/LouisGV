A box was found. They brought it into X ray.
A HUMAN BRAIN?? BAM!

The U.S discovered Loki's brain hidden in America (As a distraction from the EU, so that the Legend won't hold true. EU's mythology obviously won't applied to America, thus is what Odin wanted.) Upon noticing, Odin made all of the nuclear warhead of Russian and American to explode, thus erasing every trace of the origin of the mythology.

One day, a boy found a box when playing near the sea. (He was subornate of main after main established the global gang of the area. After loki's brain got a hold of the boy's body, he laughed:
"GAGAGAGAAGAGAGA"
"Odin!!!!!!!!! YOu're DEAD!"

After searching the boy's memory, loki tried to find the strongest person. (All of the main character has a part or "soul resemblance" of one of Loki's body part. Main got left eye (Loki tested with right eye, and bid goodbye for another time)

Have a mirror useless-seems to be character that actually become the big boss of season 1, then after bid adieu main, become the real boss (Loki)

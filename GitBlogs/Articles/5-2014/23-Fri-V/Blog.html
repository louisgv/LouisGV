World V
Alpha
After defeated <BrawnVer>, and <BrawnVer> shown him the <Crest>, and gave him the <ForceBulletGun>, Alpha jumped down the 5th floor and landed on a trash container. <TheOrganization> have issued their troop and researcher at the scene. With the <ForceBulletGun>, alpha escaped. And as he run through the spot where he saw the woman, he saw no corpse. He realized that it was all setup, a trap.

He slept on a roof. And as he tried to sleep, the <Crest> synchronized his memory with the cell within him. He got into the link network of the dead clone. There, he acquired information about one of the base <BASE1>. He decided to travel there with helps from military friends. 
[Player acquired Pause and quick save. Whenver they hit <Start>, Alpha will do a facepalm and the synchronize sequence will ask whether player want to pause or to synchronize.]

At the <BASE1>, he killed all the guard. And upon standing on a gate, player are required to do a synchronize. The password will become something inside him. <QuantumState> He entered the password. Inside, he found clones.
The password is also used on other machine inside. He inputed the pass and eventually got several base maps.
<Cinematic Scene> Alpha used the riffle he stole from the guard and fired every single bullet he has. A flood of blood from the clones drown down. Then Alpha fired the <ForceBulletGun> to destroy the mainframe, in turn ignited a slow explosion.

Alpha is WM's clone.

Well, log for my project:

+ Designing the EVENTS:

  [You wake up] -> Walk around the street, they are blocked. 
  
  The Main character have the ability to move the bloody star on the sky (That's his star)
  
  Approached by all of the weird looking Pixies
  
  There will be 13 tier of pixes for the Jam
  
  There will be 5 cities, each cities connect with each other, and they all have different mechanic and land scape.
  
    City0: Start here, human looking city, with skycrapper at the horizontal
    
    City1: Go here after talking to the invisible pixies
    
    City2: Go here after mastered the art of control the star
    
    City3: Go back to City1 and retrieve the key, there are hidden door there.
    
    City4: A room full of Pixies. Only one of them is your lover!

    + BG and FG for each city [5 * 2]
    + Pixies Sprite + Animation [13 * 5]
    + The sun [5]
    + Main Character [5]

  SCRIPT:
  
    + Rotate BG, FG arcording to where the player is. Or maybe we move it, not rotating (TEST)
    + AI for the pixies, talking and stuff
    + Animating the sun
    + Movement Script for maincharacter, and script to link him with the sun.

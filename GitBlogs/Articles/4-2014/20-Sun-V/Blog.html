RE Arc:

During his Navy/Soldier arc, he was acquaintance with WM, WM taught him how to simplify information.

"Everything could be simplified. And once you see how simplistic they are, you can expand them in any kind of big things you have," speak as he pointed to the wireless icon. "In order to work, you need to first disable interferences. Let's have the thing goes offline first. Then you could take your time and figure stuff out."

Scientist never wanted to make things complicated, they just define a way to understand things. These are the way somes used to understand what they see. An expert, is just someone who had seen lots of them, and he already saw the common images among them. That's all.

RE scheduled a rocket capsule to take him from the island to a location not so far from where WM is. He memorized the direction toward the destined location.

"You may think these eyes of mine may be well burnt by the sun, but the sea healed them. The salt rubbed against my retina, they just made it to me. I could see you with my eyes closed."

Surrounded by a troop of blue soldiers, the red dot stood with his swords crossed by his side, his eyes already zoomed on each of their index. "Pitch-pitch-pitch," bullets rain, straight at the red monster. Swords in hand, mind prepared, the monster blocked the five nearest bullets with the body of his left swords, while his right sword sliced down for ten consecutive home runs. As the right hand rotated the sword, his left hand again go down the predicted path. The volley of bullets ended in 10 clock ticks. The monster got three bullets on its [arm muscle], its thigh, and its chest, while the hunters got to eat their own bullets, they lie, enternally. The bullets inside the monster's body soon make their way outside, as the red flesh squeezed them out and restored its shape. The bullets are soft, and if he would compare it to something, he would say they are just as hard as the M&M his friends throw at him when he was at the camp.

"I'm a monster, a monster that will fuck your dream of breeding monster."
"I'm you creature, control me!"

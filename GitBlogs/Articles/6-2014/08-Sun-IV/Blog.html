"I'm the Zeus of this Era!" said the man with wing white hair. 
His hands move faster than the sound, a speed that cannot be seen normally, running with his arm, a strange spark of electric. He hit the man in the helmet with the Iron9, so fast, wind and splashed from the club. But strangely, the man in helmet dodged and catched every single chop with his knuckle and elbow. His arm move synchronically, one would saw a wave of arm lurking at the fastly chopping club.  The man landded a kick on Zeus's holding hand, trying to cause him to lost balance. But Zeus fastly dodged the kick and landed a nice hit on the man's back.

"Time to get serious~" The man yelled with a lewd voice.

He took his club he has been clinging on his side, a 1 and 3 clubs, in woods, Ultra Light. He grabbed them and transformed into his serious form. With the two club crossed in the air.

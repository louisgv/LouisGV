<h2>Frustrated</h2>

<p>Coding is Frustrated when Thing is not working. <br>
You just cannot see what is there. <br>
Cannot spot the Error.<br>
An extra Parenthesis..</p>

<h2>But I finally Solve the problem. Happy man. </h2>


<h3>The giant Swallowed the Living BlackHole, Stranded his arm into his own chest, cannot move. All of his flesh got squished into the tiny little hole in his sternum. Cannot move. His flesh spread into two, divided from his back, eventually reveal a small figure inside.</3>

<p>The process took nine hours forty five minutes. <br>
207 people dead and Injured <br>
The giant fate, unnknown. </p>

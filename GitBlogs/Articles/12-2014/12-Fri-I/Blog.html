	<p style=" text-indent: 5em;"> 
	The man was merely conventional. He need not the soul. </br>
	</p>	 
	
	<p style=" text-indent: 5em;"> 
	Clean thy soul, he walks the place with his right of the devil, his left of the purest creature. Luckily, the meat that formed his body reflects the state of his parts. The arm of a dreadful muscular man, breamed with scars and blood, for his right. For his left, a frail arm, part of a maiden, part of the only being that could make morality a thing again.</br> 
	
	</p>
	
	<p style=" text-indent: 5em;"> 
	Thy accept my seed of virtual, the descendant of the great Forest </br>
	I shall gladly accept thou seed in this pure arm of mine, make it so that it is treated with greatness of respect. The seed saw grown, and be part of me, and it shall represent you, a legacy, an end-less stream of power and piece. </br>
	</p>
	<p style=" text-indent: 5em;"> 
	The woman of the sea cannot part way with thy. </br>
	</p>
	<p style=" text-indent: 5em;"> 
	The man who resurrected by the will of the world. </br>
	</p>
	<p style=" text-indent: 5em;"> 
	Les the world remain, he remain. </br>
	</p>
	<p style=" text-indent: 5em;"> 
	There's no reason for the world to crush him, for he is naught but the only sin container there are. </br>
	</p>
	<p style=" text-indent: 5em;"> 
	Believing in the world of the man, yourself is just as dreadful.</br>
	</p>
	<p style=" text-indent: 5em;"> 

	His bloody right pierced the eyes of those with sinful tear. The blood of his arm formed a blade that can cut through the very string of life. Shaped like a scythe, none could stop its wielding. So strong a power, make the man crumble, and tremble at how he could have used it, to alter his fate. But as a man of great wisdom, he saw how the world want him to be, a watcher. Interference is naught, but just a way to make the result happen as it needed. Fate cannot change, but only hasten. Might as well making it happen as fast as possible, and cherish the moment we found happiness, and soulfulness to ourself. </br>
	</p>
	<p style=" text-indent: 5em;"> 

	Shall thou who can make fate happen be with us.</br>
	
	</p>

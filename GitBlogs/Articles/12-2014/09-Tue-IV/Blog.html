<h3>Prelude</h3>

Fate is a strange thing. The moment everything become clear, and understandable, people called it "fate".<br><br>

The moment a phenomenon appear, that match a description, it's undoubty fate.

But is it "fate"? Or it has already been determined.. yes, fate?<br><br>

Four years before the Second Big Bang. In the nation called Japan, a beast was born, given its fate and doubt.The mother, two death. The father, two death. How Unholy such creature.<br><br>

Nine months before the incident, an artifact were found deep under the pacific blue. The United States was the one behind the research. Analyzing the content, the scientists were shocked. <br>

//"A living... Brain?!" <br>

Functioning... Yet... trapped inside a lava-warped layer. Such a thing, cannot live, yet its organism swim as if the Spring inside it is as young as a child.<br>

Human were god's creation, the myth raised. <br>

But not for long...<br><br>

The great destruction, bring with it three largest nations to the deep blue. Nothing were left to be hold. Nothing were left to be touch, to be lean on, to swing. The sea struck so bad that the whole nation went gobbled under the blue, nothing can stop it. <br><br>

"Nuke the' self," they say... Nuke thy' self, damn he says...<br>

Such a race that deem them self higher simply by intelligence. Life were not much of a price.<br>

Name the price for your life<br>
Name the price for your pride<br>
Name the price for your sight<br>
Your Sigh<br>
Your Sign<br>
Thy...<br>

Must they have gotten into more trouble, Nobody know. But one sure know that, after the three largest nation stumbled into the dust and the sea, only the few islands remains. Commutes were quickly established. People, when become fewer, become closer. They are now the creature that live to survive for the rest, for over 6.5 billions souls lost to the great Destruction. Such thy were not an estimation. The 5 billions soul now rest within nations of its own. But as usual, the center ones always attract the best of the rest.<br>

The moment he was born, "God" care not for him. Such a conincidence, is merely a joke to be farthon. But, the boy despite the ignorance of god, do the deed that prove to his kind he is none of them.<br>

At the age of nine, the tragedy lead the boy to smile with a mask.<br>

"Where is god when you most need him," thy say. But in my land, they called out for the figure they came from, mother. They speak out to their mother, rather than the god those people whisper. Such a sin were deemed dead until then, when all the god has been wiped out.

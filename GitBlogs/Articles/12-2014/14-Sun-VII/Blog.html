The tale of the blade destroyer.

He who have the scythe, cursed to abandon the honored path of the warrior

He who seek to cleanse the world of the scums.

He who seek enchantment.

He who seek not the empathy of those fate deemed his lord, his god, his destiny.

No blade can cut the string of fate,

but the blade forged from his soul.

Tainted himself to the voidness,

face against time and the rest

Forge the path of a devil

Make the world of a deity

My soul is that of a proud samurai, but fate led me toward the path of a shinobi, hidden under the dark, like rats, cannot look at the sun, cannot walk on the street. My only course of action, is to make sure the path this world goes is at the interest of the original fate. I have witnessed the path of the origin, and it has been engraved inside the memory of muramasa. Shall I seize the man who dare change it, and I will.

The will of muramasa, the man who forked a thousand blades.

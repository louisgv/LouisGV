Differences between new and Instantiate in the Unity Engine

With new keyword, it makes a completely new instance of a "type" of an object.

i.e, a new Vector3(), or a new GameObject()

It basically make a new object (separated) from the previous one. This in turn slow the performance down.

With instantiate, it generate a copy of the "prefab" assigned. Since it has a root, it relate to the prefab in anyway. It is a linked clone, thus Unity can dynamically batch them together.
